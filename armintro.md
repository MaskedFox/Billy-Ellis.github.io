## An introduction to exploitation on ARM
### Part 1: Getting set up

This tutorial will cover the basics of exploit development on the ARM platform. This is aimed at beginners interested in exploit development and "hacking" so you shouldn't need too much knowledge on this subject before reading. You should, however, have a basic understanding of how a CPU works, binary, hex, what assembly code is and how to program in C.
